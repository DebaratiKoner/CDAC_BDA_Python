### Assignment 4: Dynamic Data Pipeline with Lambdas & Custom Sorting
#### Scenario
An AI classification pipeline processes raw data inputs. Each raw input is a tuple of string annotations describing a product name, its price, and rating. The pipeline needs to clean, filter, and sort these records.

#### Problem Description
Write a function `process_dataset(dataset)` that processes a dataset using built-in higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`) and `lambda` expressions:
- `dataset` is a list of tuples containing string records. Example:
  ```python
  [("Laptop", "Price: 1200", "Rating: 4.8"), ("Phone", "Price: 800", "Rating: 4.5")]
  ```
- Your pipeline must execute the following sequential steps:
  1. **Parsing**: From the incoming raw tuples, extract the product name (string), numeric price (float), and rating (float). (You can use string splitting or RegEx to isolate the numeric values).
  2. **Filtering**: Use `filter()` with a **lambda** function to keep only items with a parsed price less than or equal to `1000.0`.
  3. **Mapping**: Use `map()` with a **lambda** function to transform the filtered entries into dictionaries of the following structure:
     `{"product": <name>, "price": <float_price>, "score": <float_rating>}`.
  4. **Sorting**: Sort the resulting list of dictionaries in **descending order of their score** using `sorted()` with a **lambda** key selector. If two items have the same score, their relative order does not matter.
- The function should return the sorted list of dictionaries.

#### Sample Input
```python
data_input = [
    ("Laptop", "Price: 1200", "Rating: 4.8"),
    ("Phone", "Price: 800", "Rating: 4.5"),
    ("Mouse", "Price: 25", "Rating: 4.7"),
    ("Charger", "Price: 15", "Rating: 4.2")
]
```

#### Expected Output
```python
[
    {"product": "Mouse", "price": 25.0, "score": 4.7},
    {"product": "Phone", "price": 800.0, "score": 4.5},
    {"product": "Charger", "price": 15.0, "score": 4.2}
]
```
*(Note: "Laptop" is excluded since its price of 1200 exceeds 1000.0).*
